## Follow-up letter 
Dear Mr/Mrs,

My name is Stefaniya. I am 24 years old and  have worked in online teaching for 5 years. I got a bachelor degree in Belarusian State University and became a certified teacher of English and German, however though I am losing my German speaking skills due to lack of practice. I have been learning French as a hobby for some time already.

Being a teacher I’ve had to prepare a lot of personalized lessons for different professionals, including a lot of IT-specialists. I made up a course «English for IT», which is aimed at developing soft-skills for those from the area. My students are mostly employees from international companies (including Wargaming and Google) and European start-ups. Seeing my passion for all the IT-related topics my students offered me to try emerging in the topic myself. That’s how 8 months ago I started my path in Front-end.

I’ve started with courses on educational platforms and had lessons with a private teacher. Being perfectly self-organized and strongly motivated I keep studying and training every day.  Taking into account the variety of directions in Front-end I’d prefer having training in specific area, required for real projects. . My ultimate goal is to get employed  as a developer. Somewhat contributing to the success of a company is truly inspiring.


Best regards, 
Stefaniya Yanovich
